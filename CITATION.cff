  Large Language Models have received significant attention
  due to their abilities to solve a wide range of complex
  tasks. However these models memorize a significant
  proportion of their training data, posing a serious threat
  when disclosed at inference time. To mitigate this
  unintended memorization, it is crucial to understand what
  elements are memorized and why. Most existing works
  provide a posteriori explanations, which has a limited
  impact in practice. To address this gap, we propose a new
  approach based on sliced mutual information to detect
  memorized samples a priori. It is efficient from the early
  stages of training, and is readily adaptable to any
  classification task. Our method is supported by new
  theoretical results that we demonstrate, and requires a
  low computational budget. We obtain strong empirical
  results, paving the way for systematic inspection and
  protection of these vulnerable samples before memorization
  happens.
